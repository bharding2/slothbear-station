OH GOD DON'T USE THIS APP.  The node module used to access pandora stores your password in plaintext as a property on the module object.  I haven't written my own secure module yet because lazy.  So there is your password, lingering

If you were to use this app, it would take a youtube playlist and create a pandora station seeded with the songs contained in that playlist.
